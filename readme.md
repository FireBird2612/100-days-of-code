# I've joined the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge

I've decided to take this challenge where I will be coding for 100 days straight for minimum of 1 hour a day.

I'll be publicly posting my progress on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sg2612/)

I'm a beginner and just learning to code. I'll be taking this #100DaysOfCodeChallenge in IoT, since I'm more interested in Embedded Software and IoT.
