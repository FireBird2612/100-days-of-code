# I've joined the #100DaysOfCodeChallenge

I've decided to take this challenge where I will be coding for 100 days straight for minimum of 1 hour a day.

You can checkout this challenge ([here](https://github.com/kallaway/100-days-of-code))

I'm a beginner and just learning to code. I'll be taking this #100DaysOfCodeChallenge in IoT, since I'm more interested in Embedded Software and IoT.
