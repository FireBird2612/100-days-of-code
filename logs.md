# Day1 of coding challenge

**Date:** 31 Oct 2022

Since I'm new to the Visual Studio Code, Git and GitHub, it took some time getting around and setting up the environment but I got it done.

The project that I'm working on is RFID based Security System and the coding part for today was easy, it was just the interfacing of 16x2 display with NodeMCU ESP8266.

# Day2 of Coding Challenge

**Date:** 1 Nov 2022

Today, I worked on getting the RFID MFRC522 Module up and working with ESP8266. MFRC522 uses SPI protocol to talk to ESP8266. It was quite fun going through the datasheet for the PICC and PCD and also popular library for MFRC522.

Link for the MFRC522 Library [here](https://github.com/miguelbalboa/rfid)

# Day3 of Coding Challenge

**Date:** 2 Nov 2022

Lot of troubleshooting, got stuck so many times...
Played with arrays, especially 2D array to store the UID of PICC tags.
Again, going through datasheet, understanding how library for MFRC522 works.
But at the end felt like not much progress was made.

# Day4 of Coding Challenge

**Date:** 3 Nov 2022

Decided to practice few string concepts such as strlen, strcmp, strstr, strcat, etc.
