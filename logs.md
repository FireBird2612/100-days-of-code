Since I'm new to the Visual Studio Code, Git and GitHub, it took some time getting around and setting up the environment but I got it done.

The project that I'm working on is RFID based Security System and the coding part for today was easy, it was just the interfacing of 16x2 display with NodeMCU ESP8266.
